## Installation

Clone or download the project and unzip

You can open it directly on VS Code and run it with Live Server, as the TailwindCSS has already been built for production.
## Lessons Learned

This project has helped me understand how to correctly structure plain html websites.

Nn the other hand it was the stepping stone to start using TailwindCSS, which I consider one of the most powerful CSS Frameworks at the time.
